# Racko-Python
A simple card game of Racko (User versus Computer)

In this repo, we implement an evolutionary approach for searching a space of possible programs.

To obtain the best rules from EZS, run the Evaluation.py file.

Three scripts are generated from the rules obtained from EZS for different population sizes. These files are ScriptComb1, ScriptComb2, and ScriptComb3.
The best scripts from EZS can be compared to our own script by running the CompareScripts.py file.
